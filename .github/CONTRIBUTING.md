### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem within the program, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/EdwinRodger/MyMangaDataBase/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/EdwinRodger/MyMangaDataBase/issues/new/choose). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/EdwinRodger/MyMangaDataBase/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in UI

All the UI is made using HTML, CSS ([Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/)) and Jinja Templating Engine. You can find all the code for UI in `templates` folder

#### Make changes in code

This project follows a simple folder structure. If you want to make change which is related to manga, you can find all the code in `manga` folder. If the change is related to Home page or About Page, you can find it's code in `main` folder.
